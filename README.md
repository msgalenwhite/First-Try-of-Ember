# ember-quickstart

I am doing my best to get up to speed with Ember.  This will start as the "Ember Walkthrough" app from [the Ember Docs](https://guides.emberjs.com/v3.3.0/tutorial/ember-cli/) and will continue to grow as I learn.  Because this is a practice app, it will contain comments in the code (and in this README) that are being used to help me learn. 

## App Goals from the Ember Tutorial Docs 

* Show rentals on the home page
* Link to information about the company
* Link to contact information
* List the available rentals
* Filter the list of rentals by city
* Show more details for a selected rental
